// In addition to the above mentioned pins, 5 GPIO pins are
// available via the expansion port. These can be configured as
// input or output pins. The pins output pins by default and
// can only be accessed via the IOExpander class. The pin names
// are :
// PORT0 : GPIO_1
// PORT1 : GPIO_2, GPIO_3, GPIO_4, GPIO_5
// Configuring these as inputs is done by reading the corresponding
// port register and then doing a bitwise OR between pinMap[<gpio pin name>]
// and the register. Write the result back to the correct configuration
// register.
//
// Unregulated battery voltage, regulated +3.3V 
// and GND are also available from the expansion header.
